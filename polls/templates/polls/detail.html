<! –– 
The template system uses dot-lookup syntax to access variable attributes. 
In the example of {{ question.question_text }}, first Django does a dictionary lookup on the object question. 
Failing that, it tries an attribute lookup – which works, in this case. 
If attribute lookup had failed, it would’ve tried a list-index lookup.

<h1>{{ question.question_text }}</h1>
<ul>
{% for choice in question.choice_set.all %}
    <li>{{ choice.choice_text }}</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
